                <p>For thirteen years, the Prophet had called his people to Islam, facing ridicule, persecution, and threats. The Quraysh tribe intensified their opposition, culminating in a plot to assassinate him. On the night of migration, Angel Jibreel informed the Prophet of the assassination plot.</p>
                <p>The Prophet asked Ali ibn Abi Talib to sleep in his bed, wearing his green cloak, to deceive the assassins waiting outside. Meanwhile, the Prophet slipped away with his closest companion, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq. They embarked on a journey that would change the course of history.</p>
                <p>As he departed, the Prophet looked back at Makkah and said: "You are the most beloved place to Allah, and you are the most beloved place to me. Had your people not forced me out, I would never have left you."</p>

                <p>Rather than heading directly north toward Madinah, the Prophet and Abu Bakr took an unexpected route south to Mount Thawr. This strategic decision confounded their pursuers who searched the northern roads. They hid in a small cave on the mountainside for three days and nights.</p>
                <p>Abu Bakr's family secretly brought food and news. His son Abdullah brought intelligence, his daughter Asma brought provisions, and a shepherd named Amir concealed their tracks with his flock. The Quraysh searched desperately, offering a large reward for their capture.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <em>When Abu Bakr said, 'If one of them looks down at his feet, he will see us,' the Prophet replied, 'What do you think of two, O Abu Bakr, when Allah is their third?'</em>
                    <span> — Sahih al-Bukhari</span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>When the Quraysh trackers reached the cave entrance, Abu Bakr feared discovery. But a miracle occurred: a spider had woven its web across the entrance, and a dove had nested there. The searchers concluded no one could have entered without disturbing these, and they moved on.</p>

                <p>After three days, they emerged from the cave under cover of darkness. Their guide, Abdullah ibn Urayqit—a skilled tracker hired despite being a non-Muslim—led them along rarely-traveled coastal paths, avoiding the main caravan routes where pursuers waited.</p>
                <p>The journey was grueling. They traveled mostly at night to avoid the scorching sun, resting during the day in whatever shade they could find. The rocky terrain and soft sand made every step arduous for both riders and mounts. The approximately 450-kilometer journey would take eight to twelve days through some of the harshest terrain of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
                <p>Suraqah ibn Malik, a skilled horseman lured by the large bounty, tracked them down. Three times he charged on his horse, and three times the horse's legs sank deep into the sand. Recognizing divine intervention, Suraqah asked for amnesty. The Prophet promised him something extraordinary: "How would you feel wearing the bracelets of Khosrow?" This prophecy was fulfilled years later during Umar's caliphate.</p>
                <p>They passed by the tent of Umm Ma'bad, known for her generosity to travelers. She apologized for having nothing to offer, pointing only to a frail goat that gave no milk. The Prophet asked permission to milk it, prayed over it, and it gave abundant milk—enough for all to drink their fill, with plenty left over.</p>

                <p>On Monday, the 8th of Rabi' al-Awwal (September 23, 622 CE), after eight days of continuous travel, the Prophet arrived at Quba, just five kilometers south of Madinah. The people welcomed him with overwhelming joy and hospitality.</p>
                <p>During his four-day stay in Quba, the Prophet established Masjid Quba—the first mosque ever built in Islam. He participated in its construction, carrying stones and working alongside his companions, demonstrating that no task was beneath a leader.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <em>A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in. Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and Allah loves those who purify themselves.</em>
                    <span> — Quran 9:108</span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The Prophet later said: "Whoever purifies himself at home and comes to Masjid Quba and prays there, he will have a reward like that of an Umrah." This mosque stands to this day, continuously expanded and rebuilt, a living monument to that historic moment.</p>

                <p>On Friday, the 12th of Rabi' al-Awwal (September 27, 622 CE), the Prophet entered Madinah. The entire city poured into the streets in celebration. The women and children sang "Tala'a al-Badru 'Alayna" (The full moon has risen over us), a song of joy that Muslims still sing today.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <em>The full moon has risen over us from the valley of Wada', and we must show gratitude as long as anyone calls to Allah.</em>
                    <span> — Traditional Islamic Song</span>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Every family wanted the honor of hosting the Prophet. To avoid favoritism, he announced that wherever his camel, Al-Qaswa, stopped would be his residence. The camel walked through the streets and finally knelt on a plot of land belonging to two orphans. The Prophet purchased the land, and there he built Masjid an-Nabawi (the Prophet's Mosque).</p>
                <p>In Madinah, the Prophet established the first Islamic state. He created the Constitution of Madinah, established brotherhood between the Muhajirun (migrants) and Ansar (helpers), and built a society based on justice, faith, and mutual support. Yathrib was renamed Madinah al-Munawwarah—the Enlightened City.</p>
                <p>This moment marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. The Hijra represents not just a physical journey, but the birth of the Muslim Ummah as a distinct community with its own land, law, and identity.</p>

                <p>The Hijra was not an escape but a strategic migration that transformed human history. From this journey emerged a civilization that would spread across continents, carrying a message of monotheism, justice, and human dignity.</p>
                <p>The journey teaches us profound lessons: patience through thirteen years of persecution; trust in Allah combined with practical planning; strategic thinking in taking the longer, safer route; sacrifice in leaving behind home and comfort; brotherhood in the Ansar welcoming the Muhajirun; and divine support manifested at every critical moment.</p>
                <blockquote>
