                The Hijra marks one of the most pivotal moments in Islamic history. After enduring thirteen years of persecution in Makkah, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ received divine permission to migrate to Yathrib, which would later be known as Madinah al-Munawwarah.
            </p>
            <p class="section-content">
                This migration was not merely a physical journey across the Arabian desert, but the beginning of a new era. The approximately 450-kilometer journey took eight to twelve days through harsh terrain, pursued by enemies, sustained by faith.

                Makkah, the sacred city, birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and home to the Holy Kaaba. For thirteen years, the Prophet had called his people to Islam, facing ridicule, persecution, and threats. The Quraysh tribe intensified their opposition, culminating in a plot to assassinate him.

                On the night of migration, Angel Jibreel informed the Prophet of the assassination plot. The Prophet asked Ali ibn Abi Talib to sleep in his bed, wearing his green cloak, to deceive the assassins waiting outside. Meanwhile, the Prophet slipped away with his closest companion, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.

                Rather than heading directly north toward Madinah, the Prophet and Abu Bakr took an unexpected route south to Mount Thawr. This strategic decision confounded their pursuers who searched the northern roads. They hid in a small cave on the mountainside.

                For three days and nights, they remained hidden while the Quraysh searched desperately. Abu Bakr's family secretly brought food and news. His son Abdullah brought intelligence, his daughter Asma brought provisions, and a shepherd named Amir concealed their tracks with his flock.

            <p class="section-content">
                When the Quraysh trackers reached the cave entrance, Abu Bakr feared discovery. But a miracle occurred: a spider had woven its web across the entrance, and a dove had nested there. The searchers concluded no one could have entered without disturbing these, and they moved on.

                After three days, they emerged from the cave under cover of darkness. Their guide, Abdullah ibn Urayqit—a skilled tracker hired despite being a non-Muslim—led them along rarely-traveled coastal paths, avoiding the main caravan routes where pursuers waited.

This prophecy was fulfilled years later during Umar's caliphate when treasures from the Persian Empire reached Madinah.

                The Prophet later said: "Whoever purifies himself at home and comes to Masjid Quba and prays there, he will have a reward like that of an Umrah." This mosque stands to this day, continuously expanded and rebuilt, a living monument to that historic moment.

                On Friday, the 12th of Rabi' al-Awwal (September 27, 622 CE), the Prophet entered Madinah. The entire city poured into the streets in celebration. The women and children sang "Tala'a al-Badru 'Alayna" (The full moon has risen over us), a song of joy that Muslims still sing today.

                Every family wanted the honor of hosting the Prophet. To avoid favoritism, he announced that wherever his camel, Al-Qaswa, stopped would be his residence. The camel walked through the streets and finally knelt on a plot of land belonging to two orphans. The Prophet purchased the land, and there he built Masjid an-Nabawi (the Prophet's Mosque).

                In Madinah, the Prophet established the first Islamic state. He created the Constitution of Madinah, established brotherhood between the Muhajirun (migrants) and Ansar (helpers), and built a society based on justice, faith, and mutual support. Yathrib was renamed Madinah al-Munawwarah—the Enlightened City.
